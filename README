This is just a little css file that I keep onhand in my text editor (Notepad++), for when I quickly need to add some css3 styles. I have a few defaults for drop shadow, text shadows, glows, etc as well as the :after{} float fix. 

Please feel free to use this as you will, and if you have any defaults that you use often, please feel free to add it to this file. 

Thanks guys!
